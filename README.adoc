= TalkTalk (HuaWei) HG633 Router reboot

[qanda]
Why reboot the router?::
  When using TalkTalk's HuaWei HG633 router, the internet speed drops significantly
    after keeping the router running for a few days.
  No idea why this is happening, but reboot seems to solve the issue.
Why golang?::
  A single executable for embedded devices (e.g. raspberry pi) is preferred compared
    to other languages (e.g. node) that come with _a lot_ of small files scattering around.

== Usage

[source,shell script]
----
# Password only (assume the router is in 192.168.1.1 and the username is admin)
/path/to/talktalk-reboot -pass "SECRET"

# Full form (with some non-standard settings)
/path/to/talktalk-reboot -url "http://192.168.1.1" -name "admin" -pass "SECRET"
